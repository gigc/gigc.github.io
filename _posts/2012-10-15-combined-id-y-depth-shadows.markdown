### Paper

Published in SeDICI: [Combined ID y Depth Shadows](http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/23641)

### Abstract
>
 We present a technique to minimize the Self Shadow and Surface Acne artifacts produced by the Shadow Maps, based on a map that combines the Depth information and ID for every object in the scene. The technique is designed to be applied in the context of a perceptually correct solution for semi-interactive times.
