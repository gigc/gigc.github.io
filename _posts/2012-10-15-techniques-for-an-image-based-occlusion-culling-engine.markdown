### Abstract
>
In this work we present several techniques applied to implement an Image Based Software Occlusion Culling Engine to increase the speed of rendering general scenes with high depth complexity. This conservative culling method is based on a tiled Occlusion Map that is updated only when needed, deferring and even avoiding the expensive per pixel rasterization process. We show how the tiles become a useful way to increase the speed of visibility tests. Finally we describe how different parts of the engine were parallelized using OpenMP directives and SIMD instructions.
