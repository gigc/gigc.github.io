Published in SeDICI: [A case study on 3D virtual kitchen design with kinect sensor](http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/31658)


### Abstract

>
The industry of kitchen design and furniture fabrication has been largely aided by 3D virtual scene applications and real-time visualization software. Microsoft Kinect provides skeleton tracking and bone orientation features than can be exploited in order to improve the interaction between the user and the 3D virtual scene representation.In this work we present a case study of an interactive application that assists the kitchen design process utilizing Microsoft Kinect hardware. A 3D avatar mesh mimic the user movement in real time, gesture recognition techniques are applied to produce actions on the virtual scene and the user can interact with custom made UI widgets using the hands as mouse cursors.
