## These are our active areas of research:

### Occlusion Culling


Occlusion Culling which aims to avoid rendering objects that are occluded by other objects in the scene by discarding them at an early stage in the rendering pipeline.


### Soft Shadows


One of the fundamental problems in computer graphics is generating accurate soft shadows from area light sources. Soft shadows provide valuable cues about the relationships between objects, becoming sharper as objects contact each other and more blurry (softer) the further they are apart.
